Jappix is a fresh new open social platform which enables you to create your own cloud, wherever you want to. People must be able to get in touch with all their friends on a free decentralized network!

You can build your own Jappix installation for your own requirements: if you want to use it as a personal social client, you can download it and put it on your webserver. It's easy, fast and free.
